## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.Click here [link] (www.linkhere.com)

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Trying R markdown

```{r penguins}
library(palmerpenguins)
summary(penguins)
```

To start a new paraphraph, put two lines after this code. 

To apply italics, use *asterisks*. **Two asterisks** for bold, and hashtags for #header. More ##hashtags, the smaller the header.

* Use individual
* asterisks to create 
* bullets
